# RomanNumber

## Requirements
You can view them in [pdf format](RomanNumeralsTest.pdf)

## Testing

Setup: `npm i`

Run tests: `npm test`

### Additional notes

#### Build
There's no build, it's only intended to be tested with jest+babel

#### On commits
The commits are tiny, as mentioned in requirements (ideally every 10 minutes), so they're not 
necessarily too meaningful. However, I've tried to let them have messages as relevant as possible 
and I've partially followed the
[guidelines of the node.js community](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-guidelines).
